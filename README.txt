Run the program named "Reversi" with the java command

This project demonstrates the game of Reversi with a computer AI that uses adversarial state spaced search.
Follow the user input prompts to play the game on either a 4x4, 6x6, or 8x8 grid. There is an option to play
against a CPU with random moves, or assisted by a heuristic minimax algorithm. This meets the requirements
of playing a 4x4 and 8x8 game with an AI that uses heuristic minimax.
